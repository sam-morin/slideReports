# SSTI Vulnerability Security Audit Report

**Date:** November 10, 2025  
**Auditor:** Automated Security Review  
**System:** reports.slide.recipes

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit was conducted to assess potential exploitation of Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) vulnerabilities. The system has been secured with multiple layers of protection, and no evidence of prior exploitation was found.

## Audit Scope

1. Review of server logs for suspicious template-related activity
2. Analysis of user-created templates for malicious patterns
3. Testing of security controls with known SSTI payloads
4. Verification of sandboxing implementation

## Findings

### 1. Log Analysis - NO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY FOUND ✅

**Log Files Reviewed:**
- `/var/log/apache2/reports.slide.recipes-error.log` (478KB)
- `/var/log/apache2/reports.slide.recipes-access.log` (72KB)

**Search Patterns Used:**
- `__class__`, `__mro__`, `__subclasses__`, `__globals__`, `__init__`
- `__import__`, `exec`, `eval`, `compile`
- `open(`, `.system(`, `.popen(`

**Result:** No matches found for any dangerous patterns in logs. All logged activity appears normal:
- Scheduled email jobs running every 5 minutes
- Auto-sync jobs running every hour
- Normal SQL query execution
- No template rendering errors
- No validation failures logged

### 2. User Template Analysis - ALL CLEAN ✅

**Templates Analyzed:**
- 10 user database files checked
- 3 user-created templates found:
  - "Agent Audit (Working)" - 17,542 bytes
  - "Agent Audit (Copy)" - 17,781 bytes
  - "testaitemplate" - 16,924 bytes

**Result:** All user templates use safe Jinja2 syntax:
- Standard variable access (`{{ device.name }}`)
- Safe conditionals and loops
- Safe filters (`|length`, `|round`)
- **No dangerous patterns detected**

### 3. Built-in Template Analysis - ALL SAFE ✅

**Templates Analyzed:**
- 7 built-in templates (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Configs, Audit Logs, Snapshot Audit, Agent Overview)

**Result:** All built-in templates follow security best practices:
- No access to private attributes
- No dangerous functions called
- Proper use of Jinja2 filters
- **Fully compatible with sandboxed environment**

### 4. Security Controls Testing - ALL PASSED ✅

**Test Suite Results:**
- ✅ Validator blocks 19/19 dangerous payloads
- ✅ Validator allows 7/7 safe templates
- ✅ Sandbox blocks dangerous rendering attempts
- ✅ Size limits enforced (500KB max)
- ✅ Nested attribute access blocked
- ✅ Import statements blocked
- ✅ Safe filters still functional
- ✅ Context isolation verified

**Test Coverage:**
- Python object introspection attacks
- Code execution attempts (exec, eval, __import__)
- File system access attempts
- Module import attempts
- Attribute access tricks

## Security Controls Implemented

### Layer 1: Static Analysis (template_validator.py)
- Pattern matching for dangerous keywords
- Syntax validation
- Size limits (500KB)
- Blocks: `__class__`, `__mro__`, `__import__`, `exec`, `eval`, `open`, etc.

### Layer 2: Sandboxed Execution (sandbox_config.py)
- Uses Jinja2's SandboxedEnvironment
- Blocks access to private attributes
- Restricts dangerous built-in functions
- Prevents module imports

### Layer 3: Rate Limiting (rate_limiter.py)
- 10 template operations per hour per API key
- Prevents rapid exploitation attempts
- In-memory tracking with automatic cleanup

### Layer 4: Audit Logging
- All template create/update operations logged
- Validation failures logged with details
- API key hash recorded for accountability

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Completed ✅)
1. ✅ Implement sandboxed Jinja2 environment
2. ✅ Add template validation with pattern blocking
3. ✅ Implement rate limiting
4. ✅ Add comprehensive audit logging
5. ✅ Create security test suite

### Ongoing Monitoring
1. **Monitor logs regularly** for:
   - Template validation failures
   - Rate limit violations
   - Unusual template creation patterns

2. **Review quarterly:**
   - User-created templates for suspicious patterns
   - Security test suite results
   - Rate limiting thresholds

3. **Update security patterns** as new SSTI techniques are discovered

### Additional Hardening (Recommended)
1. ✅ **File system permissions** - Review Apache/WSGI service account permissions
2. Consider implementing template approval workflow for high-security environments
3. Consider implementing template content hashing for change detection

## Conclusion

**No evidence of exploitation found.** The system has been successfully hardened against SSTI attacks with multiple layers of defense:

- Static analysis prevents malicious templates from being saved
- Sandboxing prevents code execution even if malicious templates bypass validation
- Rate limiting prevents rapid exploitation attempts
- Audit logging provides accountability and detection

The security controls have been tested with known SSTI payloads and all tests passed successfully. All existing templates (both built-in and user-created) are compatible with the new security controls.

## Compliance Notes

- **Backward Compatibility:** ✅ All existing templates work without modification
- **Performance Impact:** Minimal - sandbox initialization is cached
- **User Experience:** Transparent - legitimate templates unaffected
